# Guess That Mnemonic

An attempt to solve [this challenge](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1597379086153764864) to guess an Ethereum wallet mnemonic based on images fed produced by [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/).

It's not particularly well structured or organized, because I wrote most of it after work while watching TV.

Ethereum mnemonics are 12 English word strings, with each word belonging to a specified word list (included in [wordlist](./wordlist) for convenience)

## Run

Use the env var `ETH_URL` to set your ethereum URL.

`go run .`

## Test

Nope.
